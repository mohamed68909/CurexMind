## 🔒 Authentication Flow

1️⃣ Register or log in:

```
POST /api/Auth/sign-up
POST /api/Auth/sign-in
```

2️⃣ Receive a JWT token in the response.

3️⃣ Use the token in secured endpoints:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

4️⃣ Access control supports:

* Role-based restrictions (Admin / Patient)
* Ownership validation (users can only access their own resources)

---

## 📅 Online Booking Flow (Patient)

Patients can book appointments directly via the API.

### Booking Process:

1. Patient logs in and receives JWT.
2. Patient calls the booking endpoint:

```
POST /api/appointments/patient/{patientId}/book
```

3. System validates:

   * User is authenticated
   * User role is Patient
   * The patientId belongs to the logged-in user
4. Appointment is created securely.
